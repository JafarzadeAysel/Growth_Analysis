## ðŸ—‚ Project Workflow

### 1. **Data Preparation with SQL**
- Wrote optimized SQL queries for tables containing millions of records.
- Used advanced SQL techniques such as:
  - `CTEs`, `JOINs`, `CASE WHEN`, `IFNULL`, `IF`, `DATE_FORMAT`, `MIN()`, `CAST()`, and subqueries.
- Ensured clean, structured data for downstream transformation.

### 2. **Data Transformation with Python**
- Connected MySQL to Python using:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd  
  from datetime import date, timedelta  
  import mysql.connector
